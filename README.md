# Rails Session Replay Attack demo

This is the companion code to [my blog post](https://binarysolo.chapter24.blog/avoiding-session-replay-attacks-in-rails) that describes how a Rails app can be vulnerable to a session replay attack; and how one can guard against it.

The `master` branch is vulnerable to a session replay attack and the `session-replay-fixed` branch contains the fix for the vulnerability.
